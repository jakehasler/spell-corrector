Start on edit distance functions




Help Sesh
========================

be sure to implement every function, for the test driver's sake.

	/* Deletion
	 * Transposition
	 * Alteration
	 * Insertion
	 * 
	 * 
	 * build a set of words from each of the four functions
	 * When you want to do deletion distance two, run all four functions on each of those word, then put all those words into another set.
	 */
	 
	 
Use String builder for each function
strings are immutable, causes for slow processing when running calculations

Object -> All classes inherit from it. 

Equals
----------
Is this object equal to the trie. 
compare two tries, see if they are the same.
To Check: 
if(o == null) return false;
else if(getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
else Trie that = (Trie) o;
compare nodeCount;
compare wordCount;
compare each Node that frequency is the same;

Hashcode
----------
Way to identify the entire object.
Consistent Always same hashCode for same trie.
get constants, multiply them in some way
 - Same value for given trie
 
toString
--------------
Give back whole list of words
alphabetical order
not frequency

have independent of use dictionary
traverse string builder, put into list as you find each one.

return root.toString();

Node
toString(String word) {
	// return own string and string of all it's children. 
	String dict = "";
	check count, add to string, then do it for each child if its not null
	
	for(children) {
		if(child != null) {
			dict += child.toString(word + charIndex);
		}
		
	}
	
	or just add everything as you build the dictionary, then toString could access
	
	return dict;
}



Edit Distances
------------------
check if a given word is in dictionary, if it is, then return it.

put string into a string builder
 
Deletion: cats
• Go through, and take out one char of each
for length
	new SB
	sb = deleteCharAt(i);
	theSet.add(sb.toString);


transposition: 
• swap two adjacent characters
for length -1
	StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(str);
	char first = str.charAt(i+1);
	char second = str.charAt(i);
	sb.setCharAt(i, firstChar);
	sb.setCharAt(i+1, secondChar);
	theSet.add(sb.toString);
	

alteration:
• swap 'x' for a every letter of alphabet
for wordlength
	new SB
	for every letter in alphabet
		stringBuilder.setCharAt(i, (char)j);
		theSet.add(sb.toString());
		
insertion: 
• inserting every letter in between each letter
for length + 1 
	for every letter of alphabet
		new SB
		sb = sb.insert(i, (char)j);
		theSet.add(sb.toString());


make sure the makeGuess function returns the newest set of the words
dictionary can change
make dictionary needs to overwrite the dictionary





Fist word wasn't found ("cares") - should have 6 nodes
Incorrect node count after 1 add
add function does not exist


in find, check frequency is greater than zero, if not, then return null;
